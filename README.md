# TIMOPython
Things I Made On Python.

This demo is a project of a game that I made all by myself. I know that I can do it better (with List Comprehension, for example), but I wanted to keep it like that because I will be a better coder tomorrow, so it's a nonsense to me to keep it in my laptop without showing anything.

I will be making better code soon.


# HOW TO PLAY

1. Go to the folder of the game.
2. ```python main.py```
3. Enjoy the DEMO.

# CONTRIBUTE

Soon.
